O, how can Love's eye be true,<BR>\nThat is so vex'd with watching and with tears?<BR>\nNo marvel then, though I mistake my view;<BR>\nThe sun itself sees not till heaven clears.<BR>\n  O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,<BR>\n  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n"
