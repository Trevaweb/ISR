I am perjured most;<BR>\nFor all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee<BR>\nAnd all my honest faith in thee is lost,<BR>\nFor I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,<BR>\nOaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,<BR>\nAnd, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,<BR>\nOr made them swear against the thing they see;<BR>\n  For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,<BR>\n  To swear against the truth so foul a lie!<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n"
