"<HTML>\n<HEAD>\n<TITLE>\nA Lover's Complaint\n</TITLE>\n</HEAD>\n<BODY>\n\n<H1>A Lover's Complaint</H1>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nFROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded<BR>\nA plaintful story from a sistering vale,<BR>\nMy spirits to attend this double voice accorded,<BR>\nAnd down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;<BR>\nEre long espied a fickle maid full pale,<BR>\nTearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,<BR>\nStorming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nUpon her head a platted hive of straw,<BR>\nWhich fortified her visage from the sun,<BR>\nWhereon the thought might think sometime it saw<BR>\nThe carcass of beauty spent and done:<BR>\nTime had not scythed all that youth begun,<BR>\nNor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,<BR>\nSome beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nOft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,<BR>\nWhich on it had conceited characters,<BR>\nLaundering the silken figures in the brine<BR>\nThat season'd woe had pelleted in tears,<BR>\nAnd often reading what contents it bears;<BR>\nAs often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,<BR>\nIn clamours of all size, both high and low.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nSometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,<BR>\nAs they did battery to the spheres intend;<BR>\nSometime diverted their poor balls are tied<BR>\nTo the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend<BR>\nTheir view right on; anon their gazes lend<BR>\nTo every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,<BR>\nThe mind and sight distractedly commix'd.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nHer hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,<BR>\nProclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride<BR>\nFor some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,<BR>\nHanging her pale and pined cheek beside;<BR>\nSome in her threaden fillet still did bide,<BR>\nAnd true to bondage would not break from thence,<BR>\nThough slackly braided in loose negligence.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nA thousand favours from a maund she drew<BR>\nOf amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,<BR>\nWhich one by one she in a river threw,<BR>\nUpon whose weeping margent she was set;<BR>\nLike usury, applying wet to wet,<BR>\nOr monarch's hands that let not bounty fall<BR>\nWhere want cries some, but where excess begs all.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nOf folded schedules had she many a one,<BR>\nWhich she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;<BR>\nCrack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone<BR>\nBidding them find their sepulchres in mud;<BR>\nFound yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,<BR>\nWith sleided silk feat and affectedly<BR>\nEnswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nThese often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,<BR>\nAnd often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear:<BR>\nCried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,<BR>\nWhat unapproved witness dost thou bear!<BR>\nInk would have seem'd more black and damned here!'<BR>\nThis said, in top of rage the lines she rents,<BR>\nBig discontent so breaking their contents.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nA reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh--<BR>\nSometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew<BR>\nOf court, of city, and had let go by<BR>\nThe swiftest hours, observed as they flew--<BR>\nTowards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,<BR>\nAnd, privileged by age, desires to know<BR>\nIn brief the grounds and motives of her woe.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nSo slides he down upon his grained bat,<BR>\nAnd comely-distant sits he by her side;<BR>\nWhen he again desires her, being sat,<BR>\nHer grievance with his hearing to divide:<BR>\nIf that from him there may be aught applied<BR>\nWhich may her suffering ecstasy assuage,<BR>\n'Tis promised in the charity of age.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold<BR>\nThe injury of many a blasting hour,<BR>\nLet it not tell your judgment I am old;<BR>\nNot age, but sorrow, over me hath power:<BR>\nI might as yet have been a spreading flower,<BR>\nFresh to myself, If I had self-applied<BR>\nLove to myself and to no love beside.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'But, woe is me! too early I attended<BR>\nA youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--<BR>\nOf one by nature's outwards so commended,<BR>\nThat maidens' eyes stuck over all his face:<BR>\nLove lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;<BR>\nAnd when in his fair parts she did abide,<BR>\nShe was new lodged and newly deified.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;<BR>\nAnd every light occasion of the wind<BR>\nUpon his lips their silken parcels hurls.<BR>\nWhat's sweet to do, to do will aptly find:<BR>\nEach eye that saw him did enchant the mind,<BR>\nFor on his visage was in little drawn<BR>\nWhat largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;<BR>\nHis phoenix down began but to appear<BR>\nLike unshorn velvet on that termless skin<BR>\nWhose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear:<BR>\nYet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;<BR>\nAnd nice affections wavering stood in doubt<BR>\nIf best were as it was, or best without.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'His qualities were beauteous as his form,<BR>\nFor maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;<BR>\nYet, if men moved him, was he such a storm<BR>\nAs oft 'twixt May and April is to see,<BR>\nWhen winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be.<BR>\nHis rudeness so with his authorized youth<BR>\nDid livery falseness in a pride of truth.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'Well could he ride, and often men would say<BR>\n'That horse his mettle from his rider takes:<BR>\nProud of subjection, noble by the sway,<BR>\nWhat rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop<BR>\nhe makes!'<BR>\nAnd controversy hence a question takes,<BR>\nWhether the horse by him became his deed,<BR>\nOr he his manage by the well-doing steed.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'But quickly on this side the verdict went:<BR>\nHis real habitude gave life and grace<BR>\nTo appertainings and to ornament,<BR>\nAccomplish'd in himself, not in his case:<BR>\nAll aids, themselves made fairer by their place,<BR>\nCame for additions; yet their purposed trim<BR>\nPieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'So on the tip of his subduing tongue<BR>\nAll kinds of arguments and question deep,<BR>\nAll replication prompt, and reason strong,<BR>\nFor his advantage still did wake and sleep:<BR>\nTo make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,<BR>\nHe had the dialect and different skill,<BR>\nCatching all passions in his craft of will:<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'That he did in the general bosom reign<BR>\nOf young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,<BR>\nTo dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain<BR>\nIn personal duty, following where he haunted:<BR>\nConsents bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted;<BR>\nAnd dialogued for him what he would say,<BR>\nAsk'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'Many there were that did his picture get,<BR>\nTo serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;<BR>\nLike fools that in th' imagination set<BR>\nThe goodly objects which abroad they find<BR>\nOf lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd;<BR>\nAnd labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them<BR>\nThan the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,<BR>\nSweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.<BR>\nMy woeful self, that did in freedom stand,<BR>\nAnd was my own fee-simple, not in part,<BR>\nWhat with his art in youth, and youth in art,<BR>\nThrew my affections in his charmed power,<BR>\nReserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,<BR>\nDemand of him, nor being desired yielded;<BR>\nFinding myself in honour so forbid,<BR>\nWith safest distance I mine honour shielded:<BR>\nExperience for me many bulwarks builded<BR>\nOf proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil<BR>\nOf this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'But, ah, who ever shunn'd by precedent<BR>\nThe destined ill she must herself assay?<BR>\nOr forced examples, 'gainst her own content,<BR>\nTo put the by-past perils in her way?<BR>\nCounsel may stop awhile what will not stay;<BR>\nFor when we rage, advice is often seen<BR>\nBy blunting us to make our wits more keen.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,<BR>\nThat we must curb it upon others' proof;<BR>\nTo be forbod the sweets that seem so good,<BR>\nFor fear of harms that preach in our behoof.<BR>\nO appetite, from judgment stand aloof!<BR>\nThe one a palate hath that needs will taste,<BR>\nThough Reason weep, and cry, 'It is thy last.'<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'For further I could say 'This man's untrue,'<BR>\nAnd knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;<BR>\nHeard where his plants in others' orchards grew,<BR>\nSaw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;<BR>\nKnew vows were ever brokers to defiling;<BR>\nThought characters and words merely but art,<BR>\nAnd bastards of his foul adulterate heart.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'And long upon these terms I held my city,<BR>\nTill thus he gan besiege me: 'Gentle maid,<BR>\nHave of my suffering youth some feeling pity,<BR>\nAnd be not of my holy vows afraid:<BR>\nThat's to ye sworn to none was ever said;<BR>\nFor feasts of love I have been call'd unto,<BR>\nTill now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''All my offences that abroad you see<BR>\nAre errors of the blood, none of the mind;<BR>\nLove made them not: with acture they may be,<BR>\nWhere neither party is nor true nor kind:<BR>\nThey sought their shame that so their shame did find;<BR>\nAnd so much less of shame in me remains,<BR>\nBy how much of me their reproach contains.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''Among the many that mine eyes have seen,<BR>\nNot one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd,<BR>\nOr my affection put to the smallest teen,<BR>\nOr any of my leisures ever charm'd:<BR>\nHarm have I done to them, but ne'er was harm'd;<BR>\nKept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,<BR>\nAnd reign'd, commanding in his monarchy.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''Look here, what tributes wounded fancies sent me,<BR>\nOf paled pearls and rubies red as blood;<BR>\nFiguring that they their passions likewise lent me<BR>\nOf grief and blushes, aptly understood<BR>\nIn bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;<BR>\nEffects of terror and dear modesty,<BR>\nEncamp'd in hearts, but fighting outwardly.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,<BR>\nWith twisted metal amorously impleach'd,<BR>\nI have received from many a several fair,<BR>\nTheir kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,<BR>\nWith the annexions of fair gems enrich'd,<BR>\nAnd deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify<BR>\nEach stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''The diamond,--why, 'twas beautiful and hard,<BR>\nWhereto his invised properties did tend;<BR>\nThe deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard<BR>\nWeak sights their sickly radiance do amend;<BR>\nThe heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend<BR>\nWith objects manifold: each several stone,<BR>\nWith wit well blazon'd, smiled or made some moan.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,<BR>\nOf pensived and subdued desires the tender,<BR>\nNature hath charged me that I hoard them not,<BR>\nBut yield them up where I myself must render,<BR>\nThat is, to you, my origin and ender;<BR>\nFor these, of force, must your oblations be,<BR>\nSince I their altar, you enpatron me.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''O, then, advance of yours that phraseless hand,<BR>\nWhose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;<BR>\nTake all these similes to your own command,<BR>\nHallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;<BR>\nWhat me your minister, for you obeys,<BR>\nWorks under you; and to your audit comes<BR>\nTheir distract parcels in combined sums.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,<BR>\nOr sister sanctified, of holiest note;<BR>\nWhich late her noble suit in court did shun,<BR>\nWhose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;<BR>\nFor she was sought by spirits of richest coat,<BR>\nBut kept cold distance, and did thence remove,<BR>\nTo spend her living in eternal love.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave<BR>\nThe thing we have not, mastering what not strives,<BR>\nPlaying the place which did no form receive,<BR>\nPlaying patient sports in unconstrained gyves?<BR>\nShe that her fame so to herself contrives,<BR>\nThe scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight,<BR>\nAnd makes her absence valiant, not her might.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:<BR>\nThe accident which brought me to her eye<BR>\nUpon the moment did her force subdue,<BR>\nAnd now she would the caged cloister fly:<BR>\nReligious love put out Religion's eye:<BR>\nNot to be tempted, would she be immured,<BR>\nAnd now, to tempt, all liberty procured.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!<BR>\nThe broken bosoms that to me belong<BR>\nHave emptied all their fountains in my well,<BR>\nAnd mine I pour your ocean all among:<BR>\nI strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,<BR>\nMust for your victory us all congest,<BR>\nAs compound love to physic your cold breast.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,<BR>\nWho, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,<BR>\nBelieved her eyes when they to assail begun,<BR>\nAll vows and consecrations giving place:<BR>\nO most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,<BR>\nIn thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,<BR>\nFor thou art all, and all things else are thine.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''When thou impressest, what are precepts worth<BR>\nOf stale example? When thou wilt inflame,<BR>\nHow coldly those impediments stand forth<BR>\nOf wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!<BR>\nLove's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense,<BR>\n'gainst shame,<BR>\nAnd sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,<BR>\nThe aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n''Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,<BR>\nFeeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;<BR>\nAnd supplicant their sighs to you extend,<BR>\nTo leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine,<BR>\nLending soft audience to my sweet design,<BR>\nAnd credent soul to that strong-bonded oath<BR>\nThat shall prefer and undertake my troth.'<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,<BR>\nWhose sights till then were levell'd on my face;<BR>\nEach cheek a river running from a fount<BR>\nWith brinish current downward flow'd apace:<BR>\nO, how the channel to the stream gave grace!<BR>\nWho glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses<BR>\nThat flame through water which their hue encloses.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies<BR>\nIn the small orb of one particular tear!<BR>\nBut with the inundation of the eyes<BR>\nWhat rocky heart to water will not wear?<BR>\nWhat breast so cold that is not warmed here?<BR>\nO cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,<BR>\nBoth fire from hence and chill extincture hath.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,<BR>\nEven there resolved my reason into tears;<BR>\nThere my white stole of chastity I daff'd,<BR>\nShook off my sober guards and civil fears;<BR>\nAppear to him, as he to me appears,<BR>\nAll melting; though our drops this difference bore,<BR>\nHis poison'd me, and mine did him restore.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,<BR>\nApplied to cautels, all strange forms receives,<BR>\nOf burning blushes, or of weeping water,<BR>\nOr swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,<BR>\nIn either's aptness, as it best deceives,<BR>\nTo blush at speeches rank to weep at woes,<BR>\nOr to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'That not a heart which in his level came<BR>\nCould 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,<BR>\nShowing fair nature is both kind and tame;<BR>\nAnd, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:<BR>\nAgainst the thing he sought he would exclaim;<BR>\nWhen he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,<BR>\nHe preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace<BR>\nThe naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;<BR>\nThat th' unexperient gave the tempter place,<BR>\nWhich like a cherubin above them hover'd.<BR>\nWho, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?<BR>\nAy me!
