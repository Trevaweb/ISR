Love is not love<BR>\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,<BR>\nOr bends with the remover to remove:<BR>\nO no! it is an ever-fixed mark<BR>\nThat looks on tempests and is never shaken;<BR>\nIt is the star to every wandering bark,<BR>\nWhose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<BR>\nLove's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<BR>\nWithin his bending sickle's compass come:<BR>\nLove alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<BR>\nBut bears it out even to the edge of doom.<BR>\n  If this be error and upon me proved,<BR>\n  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n"
