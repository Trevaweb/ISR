Three winters cold<BR>\nHave from the forests shook three summers' pride,<BR>\nThree beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd<BR>\nIn process of the seasons have I seen,<BR>\nThree April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,<BR>\nSince first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.<BR>\nAh! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,<BR>\nSteal from his figure and no pace perceived;<BR>\nSo your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,<BR>\nHath motion and mine eye may be deceived:<BR>\n  For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;<BR>\n  Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.<BR>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n"
