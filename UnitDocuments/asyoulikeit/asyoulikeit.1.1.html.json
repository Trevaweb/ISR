Orchard of Oliver's house.</H3>\n\n<p><blockquote>\n<i>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech1><b>ORLANDO</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=1>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion</A><br>\n<A NAME=2>bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,</A><br>\n<A NAME=3>and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his</A><br>\n<A NAME=4>blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my</A><br>\n<A NAME=5>sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</A><br>\n<A NAME=6>report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,</A><br>\n<A NAME=7>he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more</A><br>\n<A NAME=8>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you</A><br>\n<A NAME=9>that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that</A><br>\n<A NAME=10>differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses</A><br>\n<A NAME=11>are bred better; for, besides that they are fair</A><br>\n<A NAME=12>with their feeding, they are taught their manage,</A><br>\n<A NAME=13>and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his</A><br>\n<A NAME=14>brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the</A><br>\n<A NAME=15>which his animals on his dunghills are as much</A><br>\n<A NAME=16>bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so</A><br>\n<A NAME=17>plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave</A><br>\n<A NAME=18>me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets</A><br>\n<A NAME=19>me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</A><br>\n<A NAME=20>brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my</A><br>\n<A NAME=21>gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that</A><br>\n<A NAME=22>grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I</A><br>\n<A NAME=23>think is within me, begins to mutiny against this</A><br>\n<A NAME=24>servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I</A><br>\n<A NAME=25>know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech2><b>ADAM</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=26>Yonder comes my master, your brother.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech3><b>ORLANDO</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=27>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will</A><br>\n<A NAME=28>shake me up.</A><br>\n<p><i>Enter OLIVER</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech4><b>OLIVER</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=29>Now, sir! what make you here?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech5><b>ORLANDO</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=30>Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech6><b>OLIVER</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=31>What mar you then, sir?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech7><b>ORLANDO</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=32>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God</A><br>\n<A NAME=33>made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech8><b>OLIVER</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=34>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech9><b>ORLANDO</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=35>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?</A><br>\n<A NAME=36>What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should</A><br>\n<A NAME=37>come to such penury?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech10><b>OLIVER</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=38>Know you where your are, sir?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech11><b>ORLANDO</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=39>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech12><b>OLIVER</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=40>Know you before whom, sir?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech13><b>ORLANDO</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=41>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know</A><br>\n<A NAME=42>you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle</A><br>\n<A NAME=43>condition of blood, you should so know me. The</A><br>\n<A NAME=44>courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that</A><br>\n<A NAME=45>you are the first-born; but the same tradition</A><br>\n<A NAME=46>takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers</A><br>\n<A NAME=47>betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as</A><br>\n<A NAME=48>you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is</A><br>\n<A NAME=49>nearer to his reverence.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech14><b>OLIVER</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=50>What, boy!</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech15><b>ORLANDO</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=51>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech16><b>OLIVER</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=52>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech17><b>ORLANDO</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=53>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir</A><br>\n<A NAME=54>Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice</A><br>\n<A NAME=55>a villain that says such a father begot villains.</A><br>\n<A NAME=56>Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand</A><br>\n<A NAME=57>from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy</A><br>\n<A NAME=58>tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech18><b>ADAM</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=59>Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's</A><br>\n<A NAME=60>remembrance, be at accord.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech19><b>OLIVER</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=61>Let me go, I say.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech20><b>ORLANDO</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=62>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My</A><br>\n<A NAME=63>father charged you in his will to give me good</A><br>\n<A NAME=64>education: you have trained me like a peasant,</A><br>\n<A NAME=65>obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like</A><br>\n<A NAME=66>qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in</A><br>\n<A NAME=67>me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow</A><br>\n<A NAME=68>me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or</A><br>\n<A NAME=69>give me the poor allottery my father left me by</A><br>\n<A NAME=70>testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech21><b>OLIVER</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=71>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?</A><br>\n<A NAME=72>Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled</A><br>\n<A NAME=73>with you; you shall have some part of your will: I</A><br>\n<A NAME=74>pray you, leave me.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech22><b>ORLANDO</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=75>I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech23><b>OLIVER</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=76>Get you with him, you old dog.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech24><b>ADAM</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=77>Is 'old dog' my reward?

I will</A><br>\n<A NAME=81>physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand</A><br>\n<A NAME=82>crowns neither.

I'll tell thee, Charles:</A><br>\n<A NAME=132>it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full</A><br>\n<A NAME=133>of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's</A><br>\n<A NAME=134>good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against</A><br>\n<A NAME=135>me his natural brother: therefore use thy</A><br>\n<A NAME=136>discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck</A><br>\n<A NAME=137>as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if</A><br>\n<A NAME=138>thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not</A><br>\n<A NAME=139>mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise</A><br>\n<A NAME=140>against thee by poison, entrap thee by some</A><br>\n<A NAME=141>treacherous device and never leave thee till he</A><br>\n<A NAME=142>hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;</A><br>\n<A NAME=143>for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak</A><br>\n<A NAME=144>it, there is not one so young and so villanous this</A><br>\n<A NAME=145>day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but</A><br>\n<A NAME=146>should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must</A><br>\n<A NAME=147>blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech40><b>CHARLES</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=148>I am heartily glad I came hither to you.
