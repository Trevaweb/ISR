These exactions,</A><br>\n<A NAME=55>Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are</A><br>\n<A NAME=56>Most pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear 'em,</A><br>\n<A NAME=57>The back is sacrifice to the load.

The subjects' grief</A><br>\n<A NAME=66>Comes through commissions, which compel from each</A><br>\n<A NAME=67>The sixth part of his substance, to be levied</A><br>\n<A NAME=68>Without delay; and the pretence for this</A><br>\n<A NAME=69>Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:</A><br>\n<A NAME=70>Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze</A><br>\n<A NAME=71>Allegiance in them; their curses now</A><br>\n<A NAME=72>Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,</A><br>\n<A NAME=73>This tractable obedience is a slave</A><br>\n<A NAME=74>To each incensed will. I would your highness</A><br>\n<A NAME=75>Would give it quick consideration, for</A><br>\n<A NAME=76>There is no primer business.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech13><b>KING HENRY VIII</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=77>By my life,</A><br>\n<A NAME=78>This is against our pleasure.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech14><b>CARDINAL WOLSEY</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=79>And for me,</A><br>\n<A NAME=80>I have no further gone in this than by</A><br>\n<A NAME=81>A single voice; and that not pass'd me but</A><br>\n<A NAME=82>By learned approbation of the judges. If I am</A><br>\n<A NAME=83>Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know</A><br>\n<A NAME=84>My faculties nor person, yet will be</A><br>\n<A NAME=85>The chronicles of my doing, let me say</A><br>\n<A NAME=86>'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake</A><br>\n<A NAME=87>That virtue must go through.

What we oft do best,</A><br>\n<A NAME=93>By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is</A><br>\n<A NAME=94>Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,</A><br>\n<A NAME=95>Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up</A><br>\n<A NAME=96>For our best act.
