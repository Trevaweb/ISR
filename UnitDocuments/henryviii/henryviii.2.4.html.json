Thus it came; give heed to't:</A><br>\n<A NAME=183>My conscience first received a tenderness,</A><br>\n<A NAME=184>Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd</A><br>\n<A NAME=185>By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;</A><br>\n<A NAME=186>Who had been hither sent on the debating</A><br>\n<A NAME=187>A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and</A><br>\n<A NAME=188>Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,</A><br>\n<A NAME=189>Ere a determinate resolution, he,</A><br>\n<A NAME=190>I mean the bishop, did require a respite;</A><br>\n<A NAME=191>Wherein he might the king his lord advertise</A><br>\n<A NAME=192>Whether our daughter were legitimate,</A><br>\n<A NAME=193>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</A><br>\n<A NAME=194>Sometimes our brother's wife.

First, methought</A><br>\n<A NAME=200>I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had</A><br>\n<A NAME=201>Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,</A><br>\n<A NAME=202>If it conceived a male child by me, should</A><br>\n<A NAME=203>Do no more offices of life to't than</A><br>\n<A NAME=204>The grave does to the dead; for her male issue</A><br>\n<A NAME=205>Or died where they were made, or shortly after</A><br>\n<A NAME=206>This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,</A><br>\n<A NAME=207>This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,</A><br>\n<A NAME=208>Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not</A><br>\n<A NAME=209>Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that</A><br>\n<A NAME=210>I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</A><br>\n<A NAME=211>By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me</A><br>\n<A NAME=212>Many a groaning throe.
