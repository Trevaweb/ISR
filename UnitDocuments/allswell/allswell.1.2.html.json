He did look far</A><br>\n<A NAME=33>Into the service of the time and was</A><br>\n<A NAME=34>Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;</A><br>\n<A NAME=35>But on us both did haggish age steal on</A><br>\n<A NAME=36>And wore us out of act. It much repairs me</A><br>\n<A NAME=37>To talk of your good father. In his youth</A><br>\n<A NAME=38>He had the wit which I can well observe</A><br>\n<A NAME=39>To-day in our young lords; but they may jest</A><br>\n<A NAME=40>Till their own scorn return to them unnoted</A><br>\n<A NAME=41>Ere they can hide their levity in honour;</A><br>\n<A NAME=42>So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness</A><br>\n<A NAME=43>Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,</A><br>\n<A NAME=44>His equal had awaked them, and his honour,</A><br>\n<A NAME=45>Clock to itself, knew the true minute when</A><br>\n<A NAME=46>Exception bid him speak, and at this time</A><br>\n<A NAME=47>His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him</A><br>\n<A NAME=48>He used as creatures of another place</A><br>\n<A NAME=49>And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,</A><br>\n<A NAME=50>Making them proud of his humility,</A><br>\n<A NAME=51>In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man</A><br>\n<A NAME=52>Might be a copy to these younger times;</A><br>\n<A NAME=53>Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now</A><br>\n<A NAME=54>But goers backward.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech12><b>BERTRAM</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=55>His good remembrance, sir,</A><br>\n<A NAME=56>Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;</A><br>\n<A NAME=57>So in approof lives not his epitaph</A><br>\n<A NAME=58>As in your royal speech.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech13><b>KING</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=59>Would I were with him!

This he wish'd;</A><br>\n<A NAME=71>I after him do after him wish too,</A><br>\n<A NAME=72>Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,</A><br>\n<A NAME=73>I quickly were dissolved from my hive,</A><br>\n<A NAME=74>To give some labourers room.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech14><b>Second Lord</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=75>You are loved, sir:</A><br>\n<A NAME=76>They that least lend it you shall lack you first.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech15><b>KING</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=77>I fill a place, I know't.
