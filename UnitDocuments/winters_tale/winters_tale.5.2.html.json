How goes it now, sir? this news</A><br>\n<A NAME=27>which is called true is so like an old tale, that</A><br>\n<A NAME=28>the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king</A><br>\n<A NAME=29>found his heir?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech6><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=30>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by</A><br>\n<A NAME=31>circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you</A><br>\n<A NAME=32>see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle</A><br>\n<A NAME=33>of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,</A><br>\n<A NAME=34>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they</A><br>\n<A NAME=35>know to be his character, the majesty of the</A><br>\n<A NAME=36>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection</A><br>\n<A NAME=37>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,</A><br>\n<A NAME=38>and many other evidences proclaim her with all</A><br>\n<A NAME=39>certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see</A><br>\n<A NAME=40>the meeting of the two kings?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech7><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=41>No.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech8><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=42>Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,</A><br>\n<A NAME=43>cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one</A><br>\n<A NAME=44>joy crown another, so and in such manner that it</A><br>\n<A NAME=45>seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their</A><br>\n<A NAME=46>joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,</A><br>\n<A NAME=47>holding up of hands, with countenances of such</A><br>\n<A NAME=48>distraction that they were to be known by garment,</A><br>\n<A NAME=49>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of</A><br>\n<A NAME=50>himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that</A><br>\n<A NAME=51>joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,</A><br>\n<A NAME=52>thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then</A><br>\n<A NAME=53>embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his</A><br>\n<A NAME=54>daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old</A><br>\n<A NAME=55>shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten</A><br>\n<A NAME=56>conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such</A><br>\n<A NAME=57>another encounter, which lames report to follow it</A><br>\n<A NAME=58>and undoes description to do it.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech9><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=59>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried</A><br>\n<A NAME=60>hence the child?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech10><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=61>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to</A><br>\n<A NAME=62>rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear</A><br>\n<A NAME=63>open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this</A><br>\n<A NAME=64>avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his</A><br>\n<A NAME=65>innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a</A><br>\n<A NAME=66>handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech11><b>First Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=67>What became of his bark and his followers?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech12><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=68>Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and</A><br>\n<A NAME=69>in the view of the shepherd: so that all the</A><br>\n<A NAME=70>instruments which aided to expose the child were</A><br>\n<A NAME=71>even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble</A><br>\n<A NAME=72>combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in</A><br>\n<A NAME=73>Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of</A><br>\n<A NAME=74>her husband, another elevated that the oracle was</A><br>\n<A NAME=75>fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,</A><br>\n<A NAME=76>and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin</A><br>\n<A NAME=77>her to her heart that she might no more be in danger</A><br>\n<A NAME=78>of losing.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech13><b>First Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=79>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of</A><br>\n<A NAME=80>kings and princes; for by such was it acted.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech14><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=81>One of the prettiest touches of all and that which</A><br>\n<A NAME=82>angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not</A><br>\n<A NAME=83>the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's</A><br>\n<A NAME=84>death, with the manner how she came to't bravely</A><br>\n<A NAME=85>confessed and lamented by the king, how</A><br>\n<A NAME=86>attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one</A><br>\n<A NAME=87>sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'</A><br>\n<A NAME=88>I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my</A><br>\n<A NAME=89>heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed</A><br>\n<A NAME=90>colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world</A><br>\n<A NAME=91>could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech15><b>First Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=92>Are they returned to the court?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech16><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=93>No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,</A><br>\n<A NAME=94>which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many</A><br>\n<A NAME=95>years in doing and now newly performed by that rare</A><br>\n<A NAME=96>Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself</A><br>\n<A NAME=97>eternity and could put breath into his work, would</A><br>\n<A NAME=98>beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her</A><br>\n<A NAME=99>ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that</A><br>\n<A NAME=100>they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of</A><br>\n<A NAME=101>answer: thither with all greediness of affection</A><br>\n<A NAME=102>are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech17><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=103>I thought she had some great matter there in hand;</A><br>\n<A NAME=104>for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever</A><br>\n<A NAME=105>since the death of Hermione, visited that removed</A><br>\n<A NAME=106>house. Shall we thither and with our company piece</A><br>\n<A NAME=107>the rejoicing?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech18><b>First Gentleman</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=108>Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?</A><br>\n<A NAME=109>every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:</A><br>\n<A NAME=110>our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.</A><br>\n<A NAME=111>Let's along.</A><br>\n<p><i>Exeunt Gentlemen</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech19><b>AUTOLYCUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=112>Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,</A><br>\n<A NAME=113>would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old</A><br>\n<A NAME=114>man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard</A><br>\n<A NAME=115>them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he</A><br>\n<A NAME=116>at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,</A><br>\n<A NAME=117>so he then took her to be, who began to be much</A><br>\n<A NAME=118>sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of</A><br>\n<A NAME=119>weather continuing, this mystery remained</A><br>\n<A NAME=120>undiscovered.
