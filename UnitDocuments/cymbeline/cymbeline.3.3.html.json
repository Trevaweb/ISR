Stoop, boys; this gate</A><br>\n<A NAME=3>Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you</A><br>\n<A NAME=4>To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs</A><br>\n<A NAME=5>Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through</A><br>\n<A NAME=6>And keep their impious turbans on, without</A><br>\n<A NAME=7>Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!</A><br>\n<A NAME=8>We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly</A><br>\n<A NAME=9>As prouder livers do.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech2><b>GUIDERIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=10>Hail, heaven!</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech3><b>ARVIRAGUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=11>Hail, heaven!</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech4><b>BELARIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=12>Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;</A><br>\n<A NAME=13>Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,</A><br>\n<A NAME=14>When you above perceive me like a crow,</A><br>\n<A NAME=15>That it is place which lessens and sets off;</A><br>\n<A NAME=16>And you may then revolve what tales I have told you</A><br>\n<A NAME=17>Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:</A><br>\n<A NAME=18>This service is not service, so being done,</A><br>\n<A NAME=19>But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,</A><br>\n<A NAME=20>Draws us a profit from all things we see;</A><br>\n<A NAME=21>And often, to our comfort, shall we find</A><br>\n<A NAME=22>The sharded beetle in a safer hold</A><br>\n<A NAME=23>Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life</A><br>\n<A NAME=24>Is nobler than attending for a cheque,</A><br>\n<A NAME=25>Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,</A><br>\n<A NAME=26>Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:</A><br>\n<A NAME=27>Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,</A><br>\n<A NAME=28>Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech5><b>GUIDERIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=29>Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,</A><br>\n<A NAME=30>Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not</A><br>\n<A NAME=31>What air's from home. Haply this life is best,</A><br>\n<A NAME=32>If quiet life be best; sweeter to you</A><br>\n<A NAME=33>That have a sharper known; well corresponding</A><br>\n<A NAME=34>With your stiff age: but unto us it is</A><br>\n<A NAME=35>A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;</A><br>\n<A NAME=36>A prison for a debtor, that not dares</A><br>\n<A NAME=37>To stride a limit.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech6><b>ARVIRAGUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=38>                  What should we speak of</A><br>\n<A NAME=39>When we are old as you? when we shall hear</A><br>\n<A NAME=40>The rain and wind beat dark December, how,</A><br>\n<A NAME=41>In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse</A><br>\n<A NAME=42>The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;</A><br>\n<A NAME=43>We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,</A><br>\n<A NAME=44>Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;</A><br>\n<A NAME=45>Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage</A><br>\n<A NAME=46>We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,</A><br>\n<A NAME=47>And sing our bondage freely.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech7><b>BELARIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=48>How you speak!</A><br>\n<A NAME=49>Did you but know the city's usuries</A><br>\n<A NAME=50>And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court</A><br>\n<A NAME=51>As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb</A><br>\n<A NAME=52>Is certain falling, or so slippery that</A><br>\n<A NAME=53>The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,</A><br>\n<A NAME=54>A pain that only seems to seek out danger</A><br>\n<A NAME=55>I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'</A><br>\n<A NAME=56>the search,</A><br>\n<A NAME=57>And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph</A><br>\n<A NAME=58>As record of fair act; nay, many times,</A><br>\n<A NAME=59>Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,</A><br>\n<A NAME=60>Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story</A><br>\n<A NAME=61>The world may read in me: my body's mark'd</A><br>\n<A NAME=62>With Roman swords, and my report was once</A><br>\n<A NAME=63>First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,</A><br>\n<A NAME=64>And when a soldier was the theme, my name</A><br>\n<A NAME=65>Was not far off: then was I as a tree</A><br>\n<A NAME=66>Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,</A><br>\n<A NAME=67>A storm or robbery, call it what you will,</A><br>\n<A NAME=68>Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,</A><br>\n<A NAME=69>And left me bare to weather.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech8><b>GUIDERIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=70>Uncertain favour!</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech9><b>BELARIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=71>My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--</A><br>\n<A NAME=72>But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd</A><br>\n<A NAME=73>Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline</A><br>\n<A NAME=74>I was confederate with the Romans: so</A><br>\n<A NAME=75>Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years</A><br>\n<A NAME=76>This rock and these demesnes have been my world;</A><br>\n<A NAME=77>Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid</A><br>\n<A NAME=78>More pious debts to heaven than in all</A><br>\n<A NAME=79>The fore-end of my time.
