Plains near Rome.</h3>\n\n<p><blockquote>\n<i>Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths, with drum and colours</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech1><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=1>Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,</A><br>\n<A NAME=2>I have received letters from great Rome,</A><br>\n<A NAME=3>Which signify what hate they bear their emperor</A><br>\n<A NAME=4>And how desirous of our sight they are.</A><br>\n<A NAME=5>Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,</A><br>\n<A NAME=6>Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,</A><br>\n<A NAME=7>And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,</A><br>\n<A NAME=8>Let him make treble satisfaction.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech2><b>First Goth</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=9>Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,</A><br>\n<A NAME=10>Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;</A><br>\n<A NAME=11>Whose high exploits and honourable deeds</A><br>\n<A NAME=12>Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,</A><br>\n<A NAME=13>Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,</A><br>\n<A NAME=14>Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day</A><br>\n<A NAME=15>Led by their master to the flowered fields,</A><br>\n<A NAME=16>And be avenged on cursed Tamora.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech3><b>All the Goths</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=17>And as he saith, so say we all with him.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech4><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=18>I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.</A><br>\n<A NAME=19>But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?</A><br>\n<p><i>Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech5><b>Second Goth</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=20>Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd</A><br>\n<A NAME=21>To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;</A><br>\n<A NAME=22>And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye</A><br>\n<A NAME=23>Upon the wasted building, suddenly</A><br>\n<A NAME=24>I heard a child cry underneath a wall.</A><br>\n<A NAME=25>I made unto the noise; when soon I heard</A><br>\n<A NAME=26>The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:</A><br>\n<A NAME=27>'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!</A><br>\n<A NAME=28>Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,</A><br>\n<A NAME=29>Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,</A><br>\n<A NAME=30>Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:</A><br>\n<A NAME=31>But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,</A><br>\n<A NAME=32>They never do beget a coal-black calf.</A><br>\n<A NAME=33>Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates</A><br>\n<A NAME=34>the babe,--</A><br>\n<A NAME=35>'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;</A><br>\n<A NAME=36>Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,</A><br>\n<A NAME=37>Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'</A><br>\n<A NAME=38>With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,</A><br>\n<A NAME=39>Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,</A><br>\n<A NAME=40>To use as you think needful of the man.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech6><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=41>O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil</A><br>\n<A NAME=42>That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;</A><br>\n<A NAME=43>This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,</A><br>\n<A NAME=44>And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.</A><br>\n<A NAME=45>Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey</A><br>\n<A NAME=46>This growing image of thy fiend-like face?</A><br>\n<A NAME=47>Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?</A><br>\n<A NAME=48>A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.</A><br>\n<A NAME=49>And by his side his fruit of bastardy.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech7><b>AARON</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=50>Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech8><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=51>Too like the sire for ever being good.</A><br>\n<A NAME=52>First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;</A><br>\n<A NAME=53>A sight to vex the father's soul withal.</A><br>\n<A NAME=54>Get me a ladder.</A><br>\n<p><i>A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech9><b>AARON</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=55>                  Lucius, save the child,</A><br>\n<A NAME=56>And bear it from me to the empress.</A><br>\n<A NAME=57>If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,</A><br>\n<A NAME=58>That highly may advantage thee to hear:</A><br>\n<A NAME=59>If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,</A><br>\n<A NAME=60>I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech10><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=61>Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st</A><br>\n<A NAME=62>Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech11><b>AARON</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=63>An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,</A><br>\n<A NAME=64>'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;</A><br>\n<A NAME=65>For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,</A><br>\n<A NAME=66>Acts of black night, abominable deeds,</A><br>\n<A NAME=67>Complots of mischief, treason, villanies</A><br>\n<A NAME=68>Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:</A><br>\n<A NAME=69>And this shall all be buried by my death,</A><br>\n<A NAME=70>Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech12><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=71>Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech13><b>AARON</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=72>Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech14><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=73>Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:</A><br>\n<A NAME=74>That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech15><b>AARON</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=75>What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;</A><br>\n<A NAME=76>Yet, for I know thou art religious</A><br>\n<A NAME=77>And hast a thing within thee called conscience,</A><br>\n<A NAME=78>With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,</A><br>\n<A NAME=79>Which I have seen thee careful to observe,</A><br>\n<A NAME=80>Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know</A><br>\n<A NAME=81>An idiot holds his bauble for a god</A><br>\n<A NAME=82>And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,</A><br>\n<A NAME=83>To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow</A><br>\n<A NAME=84>By that same god, what god soe'er it be,</A><br>\n<A NAME=85>That thou adorest and hast in reverence,</A><br>\n<A NAME=86>To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;</A><br>\n<A NAME=87>Or else I will discover nought to thee.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech16><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=88>Even by my god I swear to thee I will.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech17><b>AARON</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=89>First know thou, I begot him on the empress.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech18><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=90>O most insatiate and luxurious woman!</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech19><b>AARON</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=91>Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity</A><br>\n<A NAME=92>To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.</A><br>\n<A NAME=93>'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;</A><br>\n<A NAME=94>They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her</A><br>\n<A NAME=95>And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech20><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=96>O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech21><b>AARON</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=97>Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas</A><br>\n<A NAME=98>Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech22><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=99>O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech23><b>AARON</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=100>Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:</A><br>\n<A NAME=101>That codding spirit had they from their mother,</A><br>\n<A NAME=102>As sure a card as ever won the set;</A><br>\n<A NAME=103>That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,</A><br>\n<A NAME=104>As true a dog as ever fought at head.</A><br>\n<A NAME=105>Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.</A><br>\n<A NAME=106>I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole</A><br>\n<A NAME=107>Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:</A><br>\n<A NAME=108>I wrote the letter that thy father found</A><br>\n<A NAME=109>And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,</A><br>\n<A NAME=110>Confederate with the queen and her two sons:</A><br>\n<A NAME=111>And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,</A><br>\n<A NAME=112>Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</A><br>\n<A NAME=113>I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,</A><br>\n<A NAME=114>And, when I had it, drew myself apart</A><br>\n<A NAME=115>And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:</A><br>\n<A NAME=116>I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall</A><br>\n<A NAME=117>When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;</A><br>\n<A NAME=118>Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,</A><br>\n<A NAME=119>That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :</A><br>\n<A NAME=120>And when I told the empress of this sport,</A><br>\n<A NAME=121>She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,</A><br>\n<A NAME=122>And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech24><b>First Goth</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=123>What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech25><b>AARON</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=124>Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech26><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=125>Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech27><b>AARON</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=126>Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.</A><br>\n<A NAME=127>Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,</A><br>\n<A NAME=128>Few come within the compass of my curse,--</A><br>\n<A NAME=129>Wherein I did not some notorious ill,</A><br>\n<A NAME=130>As kill a man, or else devise his death,</A><br>\n<A NAME=131>Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,</A><br>\n<A NAME=132>Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,</A><br>\n<A NAME=133>Set deadly enmity between two friends,</A><br>\n<A NAME=134>Make poor men's cattle break their necks;</A><br>\n<A NAME=135>Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,</A><br>\n<A NAME=136>And bid the owners quench them with their tears.</A><br>\n<A NAME=137>Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,</A><br>\n<A NAME=138>And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,</A><br>\n<A NAME=139>Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;</A><br>\n<A NAME=140>And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,</A><br>\n<A NAME=141>Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,</A><br>\n<A NAME=142>'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'</A><br>\n<A NAME=143>Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things</A><br>\n<A NAME=144>As willingly as one would kill a fly,</A><br>\n<A NAME=145>And nothing grieves me heartily indeed</A><br>\n<A NAME=146>But that I cannot do ten thousand more.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech28><b>LUCIUS</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=147>Bring down the devil; for he must not die</A><br>\n<A NAME=148>So sweet a death as hanging presently.</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A NAME=speech29><b>AARON</b></a>\n<blockquote>\n<A NAME=149>If there be devils, would I were a devil,</A><br>\n<A NAME=150>To live and burn in everlasting fire,</A><br>\n<A NAME=151>So I might have your company in hell,</A><br>\n<A NAME=152>But to torment you with my bitter tongue!</A><br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<A
